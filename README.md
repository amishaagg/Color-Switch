## Details
### Created by: Amisha Aggarwal and Yash Tanwar
This is a clone of the video game, Color Switch, originally developed by Fortafy Games.

A working demo of the game can be seen here.

Made as a part of project in Advanced Programming course at IIIT-Delhi.

Uses Java and JavaFx.


## Features
* An endless game with increasing difficulty
* Different kinds of obstacles, that can only be passed through the same color as the ball
Collect stars as the game proceeds, and beat the high score!
Need to go somewhere, just save the game and resume from the same position you left:)
If you lose the game, you can still continue using the stars collected
Some upbeat music to make the game more interesting, which can be paused if you want!
We would love to hear your feedback and suggestions, so we have provided our email ids in the game:)
Lots of fun:P
