## Details
### Created by: [Amisha Aggarwal](https://github.com/amishaagg) and [Yash Tanwar](https://github.com/KingYashTanwar)
This is a clone of the video game, [Color Switch](https://colorswitch.co/), originally developed by Fortafy Games.

Made as a part of project in Advanced Programming course at IIIT-Delhi.

Uses Java and JavaFx.


## Features
* An endless game with increasing difficulty
* Different kinds of obstacles, that can only be passed through the same color as the ball
* Collect stars as the game proceeds, and beat the high score!
* Need to go somewhere, just save the game and resume from the same position you left:)
* If you lose the game, you can still continue using the stars collected
* Some upbeat music to make the game more interesting, which can be paused if you want!
* We would love to hear your feedback and suggestions, so we have provided our contact info in the game:)
* Lots of fun:P

## Technical features 
* Uses design patterns 
1. Facade: serialise() provides a high level interface that makes the system easier to use
2. Decorator: Buffered Reader and Scanner are examples of Decorator objects
3. Composite: The Game class contains instances of Star, Obstacle and Color Switchers
4. State: Game can be saved in either of the 5 files, the actual one is decided on the basis of the current count
* Uses object oriented programming
